In previous times, we used to do **lexical search** where the search engine looks for the literal matches of the query without understanding the overall meaning of it. **Semantic Search** on the other hand seeks to improve search accuracy by understanding the searcher's intent and the contexutal meaning of the query. This is done through a Natural Language Processing techniques such as NER(Named Entity Recognition).\n\nUsage of Semantic search enables articulation of domain knowledge at a high level of expresiveness and could enable the user to specify their intent in more detail at query time. Semantic search is used strategically by companies for knowledge management. It allows for meaningful and seamless data sharing by employees across teams and locations based on contextual references.\n\nIn this notebook, we'll be working with Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) Question Classification dataset together with ANNOY(Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah) in Cohere to develop a semantic search dataframe.
